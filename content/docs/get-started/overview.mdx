# Overview of Addis AI API

The Addis AI API provides integration capabilities for Ethiopian language technology in applications. The platform offers services for Amharic and Afan Oromo.

## Introduction to Addis AI

Addis AI is a language technology provider focused on Ethiopian languages. The API provides functionality for:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Conversational AI" description="Text-based chatbots and assistants" />
  <Card title="Text-to-Speech" description="Converting text to spoken audio" />
  <Card title="Speech-to-Text" description="Transcribing spoken audio to text" />
  <Card title="Multi-modal Processing" description="Handling text, audio, and image inputs" />
</Cards>

The goal is to provide AI capabilities for languages that have limited support in existing language technology platforms.

## Supported Languages

Addis AI currently supports two Ethiopian languages:

<Cards>
<Card title="Amharic (am)">
  - The official working language of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia
  - Uses the Ge'ez script
  - Language code: `am`
</Card>
<Card title="Afan Oromo (om)">
  - A Cushitic language spoken in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa
  - Uses a Latin-based alphabet (Qubee Afaan Oromoo)
  - Language code: `om`
</Card>
</Cards>

## API Structure

The Addis AI API follows RESTful design with JSON-based requests and responses.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Technical Design">
    - **Request/Response Format:** Structured JSON for standard requests, multipart/form-data for file uploads
    - **Error Handling:** Standardized error codes and messages across all endpoints
    - **Performance:** Optimized for standard request-response patterns
    - **Multi-modal Support:** API accepts text, audio files, and image attachments
    - **Stateless Architecture:** No server-side state management; conversation context can be maintained client-side through the conversation history parameter
    - **Security:** HTTPS-only communication with API key authentication
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Core Components">
    1. **Authentication:** API key verification system
    2. **Endpoints:**
       - `/chat_generate` - Text generation and chat functionality
       - `/audio` - Text-to-speech conversion
    3. **Language Models:** Specialized models for Amharic and Afan Oromo
    4. **Input Processing:** Handles text input and file uploads
    5. **Response Generation:** Produces formatted text and audio responses
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

The API is designed to provide reliable Ethiopian language capabilities with a focus on accuracy and functionality rather than speed or real-time processing.
