import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

Here are answers to the most common questions from developers and enterprise teams.

## General

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Which languages are currently supported?">
    We currently provide production-grade support for **Amharic** and **Afan Oromo**. 
    
    We also support **English** for translation pairs (e.g., English to Amharic). Experimental support for Tigrinya and Somali is available in our beta models.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is Addis AI different from GPT-4 or Claude?">
    Generic models are trained on English-heavy internet data. They often struggle with the **complex morphology** of Ethiopian languages, leading to grammatical errors and hallucinations.
    
    **Addis AI** models are trained from scratch on native datasets, ensuring high-accuracy syntax, cultural relevance, and correct handling of Ge'ez punctuation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use this for commercial applications?">
    **Yes.** You can use our API to build commercial products, internal tools, or public-facing applications. Check our [Terms of Service](https://addisassistant.com/terms-of-service) for content policies regarding hate speech and misinformation.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Technical

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="How are tokens counted for Amharic?">
    Tokenization for Ge'ez script is denser than Latin scripts. 
    
    On average, **1 Amharic word ≈ 1.5 to 1.8 tokens**.
    For example, the word `"ኢትዮጵያ"` might be tokenized into 2-3 fragments depending on the context. We recommend estimating costs with a buffer compared to English text.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the Context Window size?">
    Our flagship model `Addis-፩-አሌፍ` supports a context window of **250,000 tokens** (roughly 152,000 Amharic words). 
    
    This includes both your input prompt and the model's generated output.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is the audio generation taking time?">
    Text-to-Speech (TTS) is computationally intensive. A 10-second audio clip takes approximately 1-2 seconds to generate. 
    
    For long documents, we strongly recommend using the **Streaming API** (`stream: true`) to play audio chunks instantly as they are generated.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Privacy & Security

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Do you train on my API data?">
    **No.** Data sent to the API is **not** used to train our base models. 
    
    We adhere to strict data privacy standards. Your inputs and outputs are processed ephemerally and are not stored for model improvement purposes unless you explicitly opt-in to a feedback program.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where is my data processed?">
    Our inference infrastructure runs on secure, enterprise-grade cloud providers. All data in transit is encrypted via TLS 1.2+.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I deploy Addis AI on-premise?">
    Yes. For Enterprise clients in sectors like Banking, Government, or Healthcare, we offer **On-Premise** or **Private Cloud** deployments to meet data sovereignty requirements. 
    
    Please [Contact Sales](mailto:enterprise@addisassistant.com) for details.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Billing

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Is there a Free Tier?">
    Yes. Every new account receives **500 ETB free starter credits**. Once these are consumed, you can upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go plan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I check my usage?">
    You can view real-time usage statistics, token consumption, and remaining credits in the **[Platform Dashboard](https://platform.addisassistant.com/usage)**.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I hit my Rate Limit?">
    The API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error. 
    
    If you are on the Free plan, you are limited to 60 requests per minute. Upgrading to Pro increases this limit significantly.
